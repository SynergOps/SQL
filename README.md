# SQL Training Material used in sessions

This repository is used during our training sessions on SQL. 
It contains a collection of SQL lessons designed to help users learn and practice various aspects of practical use of SQL. Each lesson includes step-by-step instructions and exercises
that users can work through to gain a deeper understanding of SQL syntax and functionality.

The repository includes a mock database that you can import and use for practicing SQL commands. The mock database contains sample table and data that you can query using SQL commands that are described in the provided lessons.

# Mock Scenario: Bitcoin Custody Service Startup

## Background

Imagine you're working for a Bitcoin custody service startup called **"GetRekt"**. 
The company provides secure storage and management solutions for Bitcoin users, allowing them to
store their private keys and manage their Bitcoin balances securely.

Your team has developed a database that stores user information, bitcoin wallet addresses, balances and other relevant data. Your task is to help design queries and analyze the database to
provide insights into user behavior and Bitcoin transactions. 

This mock scenario, as used during traning sessions, provides a clear context and purpose for the database, making it easier for students to understand why certain SQL queries are relevant and how they can be
applied in real-world applications. It also makes learning more engaging by connecting the exercises to a plausible narrative.
